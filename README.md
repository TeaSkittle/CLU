### Why CLU?
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a name taken from the Tron films, the character CLU   
&nbsp;&nbsp; was designed to create the perfect system, as is this program :)

&nbsp;&nbsp; Quote from Tron Legacy:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin Flynn: You are CLU.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLU: I am CLU.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin Flynn: You will create the perfect system.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLU: I will create the perfect system.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin Flynn: [embracing CLU] Together we're going to change the world, man.
